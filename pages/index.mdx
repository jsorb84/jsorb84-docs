# Introduction

Here you will find everything I have written that is available for the public domain. This will also serve as my unofficial knowledge base
mainly working on my documentation skills and a place to keep my code organized.

## Contact Me

I am always interested in meeting fellow coders and making friends. If you have any comments or questions, please feel free, I believe one will
always learn more with friends along for the ride, if you're interested in sharing idea, bouncing code around, or just want to learn something
feel free to add me!
